# Tensorflow_Learning

This is the collection of practicing training models files during my study of tensorflow on python.

## example.py
This contains my trying for several functions

## random_train.py
It uses cross entropy as the error function to train on the randomly generated data.

## tensorflow_mnist.py
This uses cross entropy, L2 regularization and exponentially decay learning rate as the parameterfor a single-layer NN with BP algorithm to train on MNIST dataset, reaching 97.99% accuracy after 30000 training steps.
